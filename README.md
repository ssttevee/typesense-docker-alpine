# typesense-docker-alpine

Typesense built for alpine/musl.

Additionally, IPv6 peering functionality has been patched in.

NOTE: This build takes a fairly long time to complete. A host with a generous number of cores is recommended, or simply leave it running overnight. All available will be used for building.

### Note on fully static builds

If somebody wanted a completely statically-linked binary, this should take you 95% of the way there.
